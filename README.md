### React Shopping List 

#### Getting Started
  - Fork 
  - Clone your fork
  - yarn & yarn start
  - Make sure you see "Hello World"

#### Branching 
  - Make a branch for EVERY issue you work on
  - Branch name should follow this convention: issueType-issueNumber-issueName
  - First word dictates whether the branch is for a feature, enhancement, bug, etc.
  - Second word is the issue number. Everytime an issue is created on github, it will have a coresponding id. That will be your issue number 
  - Anything following will be the name of the issue. 
  - Example: feature-2-creating-item-form

#### Pull Requests 
  - One PR per branch. Preferably one commit per PR unless modifications were requested.
  - Commit message should be the name of the branch.
